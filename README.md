### Hi there :wave:

I am a person interested in high scale for games, I am the lead developer of [DonutSMP](https://github.com/DonutNetwork).

- Creator and maintainer of [BeeFormat](https://github.com/DonutNetwork/BeeFormat), a world format focused on high speed deserialization/serialization of minecraft worlds.
- I have wrote a sharding system called Goliath and used on DonutSMP, achieved a global record of 8500 concurrent players online in a single survival gamemode.
- Creator and maintaner of Omega, Omega is a component of Goliath, it is a multi instance queue service, that reduces overload of Minecraft servers by adding actual queues of connection that work flawless,with player limits and balancing itself with information such as MSPT too, it works as a load balancer.
- Creator of Poseidon, it is the best chat filtering system that has multiple checking components, it re-adapts itself by adding new filters and checks, it also uses AI moderation tools as its own adapting system, with multiple algorithm checks for past blocked sentences, etc.

Images attached are managed by Pegasus(with grafana and prometheus), a private software that handles all Statistics of Goliath and more.
